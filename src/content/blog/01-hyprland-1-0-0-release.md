Hyprland is a Wayland-based dynamic tiling compositor with all the
eye-candy and extensibility. Its popularity has grown rapidly, thanks
to an active and vibrant community of users.

One fantastic addition from this community is a Tree-sitter grammar
for Hyprlangâ€”the configuration "language" used by Hyprland. As an avid
Emacs user and a Hyprland enthusiast, I saw an opportunity to bring
this integration to Emacs.

I'm thrilled to announce the first release of hyprland-ts-mode, an Emacs
major mode for editing Hyprland configuration files. This package is
built to make working with Hyprlang a breeze by leveraging the
Tree-sitter grammar for Hyprlang.
